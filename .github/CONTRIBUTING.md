# How to contribute

We’d like to thank you for considering to contribute and donate your time to our project :heart_eyes::heart:  
You’re a maverick, a code-hero of sorts! :rocket::fist:

All contributions are welcome and we will always consider your request/PR or issue. We will likely even dream about it because that’s how hard we think
about the _GUI_.

The fact that you’re here and reading this means you care. We do too so let’s agree on some basic rules so we are all on the same page:

* To foster a welcoming environment we pledge to be respectful to everyone and we will enforce this respect everywhere we can.
* We love your input and will consider it in the large scope this project exists in. If we are unable to accomundate your request we will give you the reasons
	and are open to discuss them with you (to a sensible degree).
* We are not always right and encurage a public discourse to smooth those edges we humans have when we think we are right.
* Please remember that we are doing the best we can and sometimes that means we are stuck in meetings and can’t reply right away. We promiss we probably
	already saw your issue by glancing at our phones in the meeting and are thinking about what you said while unable to reply because our boss is talking in
	front and and we have to hide our phone under the table. Now we have to also remember what our boss just said. Darn!

## Submitting an issue

Go ahead and describe the issue as best as you can and name the affected module. Screenshots can help a lot and if you have a URL where the problem is
visible we will click it. We sometimes use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) to illustrate an issue.

### What repo should I submit my issue to?

All issues have to be submitted against the [GUI-source](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source) repo regardless of what module its talking about.
This helps us keep track of them all.

## Submitting a pull request

If you have a fix and wish to merge it with us please check our [coding styleguide](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/wiki/Styleguide).
All PR should be against the `dev` branch to keep the master branch clean for releases.

### What repo should I submit my PR to?

The [GUI-source](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source) repository only holds the build tools and documentation. If you have found a bug or want to
improve something in our GUI-modules please go the the relevant repo and submit a pull-request there. To find your module go to the
[our GitHub org page](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam) and search for it.

Make sure you tested your changes and describe thoroughly what you changed.

Thank you again! :heart:
