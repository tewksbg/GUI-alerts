### Release History

* v1.0.2 - `JS` `HTML` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~
	* We got word that using our JavaScript in dynamic DOM application was a bit... clunky. Clunky wasn't good enough for us so we refactored all Javascript
		modules to unclunk all the things. Beware though, some JavaScript classes had to be injected to keep the modules clunk-free.
		[#140](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/140)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* As the built-in faux italic cut off the descenders in alert messages, we changed the font style to a more native style.
		[#130](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/130)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
