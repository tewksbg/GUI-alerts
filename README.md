### Release History

* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.4 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fixed flexbox bug with a handy workaround.
		[#194](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/194)
	* Worked on the no-js fallback and made usability of large alerts better. Not that you should use large alert messages. Let's keep those grumpy messages
		as short as possible.
	* Icons in those handy alert messages are now tinting the way they should have right from the start.
		[#190](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/190)
* v1.0.3 - `HTML` `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~
	* You know the feeling when you're trying to buy a beer at the corner pub on a Friday afternoon after you've just finished a sprint that was particularly
		difficult and the alert message says: "No more funds" and you know you left the other card at home and never got around to setting up cardless cash?
		Long story short: You now get to make that alert message a bit easier on the eyes by adding icons inside of it to help make Friday afternoons fun again.
		[#177](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/177)
* v1.0.2 - `JS` `HTML` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~
	* We got word that using our JavaScript in dynamic DOM application was a bit... clunky. Clunky wasn't good enough for us so we refactored all Javascript
		modules to unclunk all the things. Beware though, some JavaScript classes had to be injected to keep the modules clunk-free.
		[#140](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/140)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* As the built-in faux italic cut off the descenders in alert messages, we changed the font style to a more native style.
		[#130](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/130)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
